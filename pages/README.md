# PAGES

This contains the code to render the posts using Pages.

You can see posts created. 

NOTE: The like button API is implemented. However, when I call it on
button click it throws an error. Hence, removed the API call for the
submission purposes. I could have cracked it if I had more time on my hand.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
